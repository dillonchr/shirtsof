            <h1>T-shirts rule!</h1>
            <p>So then why do I have to get rid of so many of them? Oh right because they're hilarious when I find them at the store but when I get home and realize how they stack up to what else I have on my shelf and what needs I have stored in my brain they don't measure up to daily-usage-worthiness.</p>
            <p>So please join me in reviewing some of the past follies and sterling examples of good classy taste when it comes to the department of keeping one's bod swaddled in fabric.</p>
            <p>It's a newsletter signup to see shirts I don't have anymore. Help me remember them in a grand send-off. Monthly? Weekly? Spontaneously sent newsletter hand crafted with love and help from MailChimp.</p>
